        <strong>Hello! I’m Lotus Lei,</strong> a 17-year-old from the often
        rainy, sometimes sunny Vancouver, B.C. I’m deeply interested in film &
        TV, psychology, and English literature. My passion lies within analyzing
        stories—not just to understand the plot or characters, but to see how
        they influence the way we think and feel. I’ve always been fascinated by
        the connection between psychology and storytelling. Whether it’s
        understanding the motivations behind a character’s actions or exploring
        the psychological depth of a narrative, I love how stories can shape our
        emotions and perceptions. I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to dive
        deeper into the way media impacts us, and I’m eager to keep exploring
        these interests as I continue my academic journey. Looking ahead, I’m
        excited to see how these interests come together. I’m particularly
        interested in how media and storytelling can shape how we think and act.
        I plan to continue exploring this passion, whether through psychology or
        something in the film industry.
